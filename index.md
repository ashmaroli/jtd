The files `/assets/jekyll-*/*` are copies of `Gemfile` and the resulting
`search-data.json` generated by `/assets/js/zzzz-search-data.json`.
(The only difference between the latter and 
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs/master/assets/js/zzzz-search-data.json`
is the replacement of `''` by `""`, to circumvent an issue on macOS.)

Jekyll-3.8.7 and 4.1.1 produce the expected content with rendered search data.

Jekyll-4.2.0 (run locally) produces content with unrendered search data.
